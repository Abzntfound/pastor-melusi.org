                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>International Breakthrough Ministries was formed in 2010 by the Founder Pastor Souzie Balosa Lukeni who was born originally in Congo Kinshasa but moved to the UK to settle.</p>
                <p>Pastor Melusi had worked very close to Pastor Souzie and when the woman of God passed away, God by his spirit led pastor Melusi to takeover. When he took over all there was nothing left as all the people had left after Pastor Souzie had passed on but God worked marvellously with Pastor Melusi to give him strength to rebuild.</p>
                <p>Together with his wife Mrs Abegail Dube they have worked tirelessly to push the name of Jesus and to build the church. As we now speak International Breakthrough Ministries is in 3 cities across the UK and pastor Melusi is invited to speak all over the world.</p>
